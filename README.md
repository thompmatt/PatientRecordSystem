# Patient Record System
This program implements a binary search tree which stores a set of patient records. The left subtree contains the patient records of all the patients who are older than the patient who's PatientRecord is stored at the parent node. The right subtree contains the patient records of all the patients who are younger than the patient who's PatientRecord is stored at a parent node. With this project, I acquired more knowledge on binary search trees, utilizing said data structure to implement a real-world application useful for hospitals and medical institutes.

This was a project for the CS 300: Programming II course at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, taught by Prof. Laura LeGault.
